## Getting Started

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This template requires [Vite+ `vp`](https://viteplus.dev/guide/#install-vp) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) to be installed.

1. [Use this template](https://github.com/new?template_name=tanstarter-plus&template_owner=mugnavo) or create a project using our CLI:

   ```
   pnpm create mugnavo -t monorepo
   ```

2. Create `.env` files in [`/apps/web`](./apps/web/.env.example) and [`/packages/db`](./packages/db/.env.example) based on their respective `.env.example` files.

3. Generate the initial migration with drizzle-kit, then apply to your database:

   ```sh
   pnpm db generate
   pnpm db migrate
   ```

4. Run the development server:

   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```

   The development server should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

> [!TIP]
> If you want to run a local Postgres instance via Docker Compose with the dev server, you can use the [dev.sh](./dev.sh) script:
>
> ```sh
> ./dev.sh # runs "vp run dev --recursive"
> # or
> ./dev.sh web # runs "vp run --filter=@repo/web dev"
> ```

## Deploying to production

The [vite config](./apps/web/vite.config.ts#L15-L16) is currently configured to use Nitro to deploy on Netlify, but supports many other [deployment presets](https://nitro.build/deploy) like Vercel and Node.

While Nitro provides a great multi-provider default, the official [@netlify/vite-plugin-tanstack-start](https://npmx.dev/package/@netlify/vite-plugin-tanstack-start) is also available for Netlify deployments.

Refer to the [TanStack Start hosting docs](https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/hosting) for deploying to other platforms.

<!-- ### Build caching

Vite+ has support for [caching](https://viteplus.dev/guide/cache) via Vite Task. A `cache:build` task is configured in [`apps/web/vite.config.ts`](./apps/web/vite.config.ts) that can enable faster builds via caching. When deploying, use `vp run cache:build` or `pnpm run cached-build` as the build command to take advantage of this feature. -->

## Goodies

#### Git hooks

We use [Vite+ Commit Hooks](https://viteplus.dev/guide/commit-hooks) to run git hooks with the following tools:

- [`vp staged`](https://viteplus.dev/guide/commit-hooks#vp-staged) - Run Oxfmt to format staged files on commit (`pre-commit`).

#### Scripts

This template is configured for **[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)** by default. Check the root [package.json](./package.json) and each workspace package's `package.json` for the full list of available scripts.

- **`auth:generate`** - Regenerate the [auth db schema](./packages/db/src/schema/auth.schema.ts) if you've made changes to your Better Auth [config](./packages/auth/src/auth.ts).
- **`ui`** - The shadcn/ui CLI. (e.g. `pnpm ui add button`)
- **`format`**, **`lint`** - Run Oxfmt and Oxlint, or both via `pnpm check`.
- **`deps`** - Selectively upgrade dependencies via taze.

> [!NOTE]
> To switch to another package manager (e.g., bun or npm), you'll need to replace or remove [`pnpm-workspace.yaml`](./pnpm-workspace.yaml), which uses pnpm [catalogs](https://pnpm.io/catalogs). Bun and Yarn have their own equivalents, but the file formats may differ.

#### Utilities

- [`/auth/src/tanstack/middleware.ts`](./packages/auth/src/tanstack/middleware.ts) - Sample middleware for forcing authentication on server functions.
- [`/web/src/components/theme-toggle.tsx`](./apps/web/src/components/theme-toggle.tsx), [`/ui/lib/theme-provider.tsx`](./packages/ui/lib/theme-provider.tsx) - A theme toggle and provider for toggling between light and dark mode.

## Third‑party integrations

The template is kept minimal by default, but is compatible with many third‑party integrations. Here are a few we use in our projects:

- [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) - analytics & observability
- [Resend](https://resend.com/) - email
- [Polar](https://polar.sh/) - billing
- ... and many more!
